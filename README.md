## Amazon Q for Eclipse

Amazon Q Developer helps users build faster across the entire software development lifecycle by providing tailored responses and code recommendations that conform to their team's internal libraries, proprietary algorithmic techniques, and enterprise code style.

### Getting Started

* **Pro Tier** - if your organization is on the Amazon Q Developer Pro tier, log in with single sign-on.

### Features

* Code faster with inline code suggestions - Amazon Q Developer generates real-time code suggestions ranging from snippets to full functions based on your comments and existing code. It also supports CLI completions and natural language–to-bash translation in the command line.
* Get assistance - Amazon Q Developer can generate code, explain code, and provide answers about software development.
* Customize code recommendations - Securely connect Amazon Q Developer to your private repositories to generate even more relevant code recommendations, ask questions about your company code, and understand your internal code bases faster.
